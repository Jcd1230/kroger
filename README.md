# Kroger API
Node for accessing the Kroger API using Google's Puppeteer. This is almost a requirement for accessing the Kroger API due to the Akamai proxy and JavaScript-based protection. Certain HTTP headers, cookies generated by JS, and JS-generated POSTS must be present, or the proxy begins to lock you out.
